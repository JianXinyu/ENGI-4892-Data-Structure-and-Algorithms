Implement a simple set ADT.

A *set* is a data structure that holds values, ignoring duplicates. In this assignment, you will implement a simple ADT (abstract data type) for a set. You do not need to implement set operations such as computing unions and intersections; instead, you only need to implement the methods declared in [Set.h](https://memorialu.gitlab.io/Engineering/ECE/Teaching/data-structures/website/assignment/3/Set.h):

I will test your code with test cases such as the following:

```C++
Set<int> s;
for (int n : { 22, 93 })
{
	s.insert(n);
}

CheckInt(22, *s.find(22));
Check(s.find(99) == s.end(), "find(99) should equal end()");
```

For this assignment, you may not use **any** of the STL: you must implement **everything** yourself. Also as always, please ensure that your assignment submission is **your own individual work**. Finally, if youâ€™re not clear about anything, please ask!
