1. Discuss the merits of using `std::shared_ptr` vs `std::unique_ptr` to manage the ownership of child nodes in a tree.

   Here are functions of unique_ptr and shared_ptr.

   1. unique_ptr: allows only one owner of the underlying pointer
   2. shared_ptr allows multiple owners of the same pointer (Reference count is maintained)

   Considering the definition of the tree. The pointer points to the child is better to use unique_ptr. Since the child only has one parent node. 

2. Implement a tree ADT (*abstract data type*) in which each node can have an arbitrary number of children. Implement the following methods to populate your tree. Write test code to build a tree with some pre-defined structure and use a debugger to verify that the tree has the structure you intended.

   ```C++
   /**
    * Set the value of the tree's root node.
    */
   Tree& setRoot(T value);
   
   /**
    * Add a leaf node to the top level of this tree.
    */
   Tree& addChild(T value);
   
   /**
    * Add a subtree to the top level of this tree, using move
    * semantics to "steal" the subtree's nodes.
    */
   Tree& addSubtree(Tree<T>&&);
   ```

Consider the alternate child-and-sibling structure [described here](https://memorialu.gitlab.io/Engineering/ECE/Teaching/data-structures/website/modules/trees/child-and-sibling/).

1. Does this necessitate a change to your smart-pointer strategy (using `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr`)? Why or why not?

   No. I can still use unique_ptr. because every sibling only points to one child.

2. Re-implement your tree data structure to use the child-and-sibling node structure.

   All changes are in Node class. the addChild method is changed. a new method named addSibling is added.  Two field: child_ and sibling_ are added.

1. Implement pre- and post-order traversal in your tree data structure, passing an instantiation of the following function template to your traversal method (i.e., your test code should call something like `myTree.visitPreorder(visit<double>)`):

   ```C++
   template<typename T>
   void visit(const T &value)
   {
   	static size_t i = 0;
   	std::cout << "Node " << i++ << ": " << value << "\n";
   }
   ```

   pseudocode:

   ```python
   def visit_preorder(node, fn):
   	if node is None:
   		return
   	
   	fn(node)
   	for child in children:
   		visit_preorder(child, fn)
   
   def visit_postorder(node, fn):
   	if node is None:
   		return
   	
   	for child in children:
   		visit_preorder(child, fn)    
       fn(node)
   ```

   

2. [optional] Implement level-order traversal for your tree data structure. You may find the [queue-based algorithm described on Wikipediaâ€™s "Tree Traversal" page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Breadth-first_search_2) to be helpful.

## Exercises for 3 Jul 2020

Given the partial `BinarySearchTree` class template in [BST.h](https://memorialu.gitlab.io/Engineering/ECE/Teaching/data-structures/website/modules/trees/exercises/BST.h), the stub test code in [bst-test.cc](https://memorialu.gitlab.io/Engineering/ECE/Teaching/data-structures/website/modules/trees/exercises/bst-test.cc) and the provided [Makefile](https://memorialu.gitlab.io/Engineering/ECE/Teaching/data-structures/website/modules/trees/exercises/Makefile):

1. Implement the `insert`, `Node::min` and `Node::max` methods recursively.

   see code in BST.h

2. Implement the `BinarySearchTree::print` method using a recursive `Node::print` method.

   see code in BST.h

3. [optional] Instantiate a binary search tree to contain more interesting objects (e.g., transcript objects that contain vectors of course result objects) and with a non-trivial comparison function (e.g., one that compares the mark in a specific course between two transcripts). Change the "keep a count of duplicates" approach in the given `Node` to instead keep a linked list of "duplicates" (which may not be entirely identical, merely identical in one course).
